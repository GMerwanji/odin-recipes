            <li>1 scallion, thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a medium pot to medium heat</li>
            <li>Add the butter. Once melted add the ramen packet and Kraft Mac and Cheese packet. Stir</li>
            <li>Once foaming, add a splash of milk. Mix it all together before adding the rest of the milk, along with 1 cup of water</li>
            <li>Bring the liquid to a simmer, then let it roll for about 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Remove from heat</li>
            <li>Place a nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat</li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of butter and let it melt and get foamy</li>
            <li>Lay the bread in the skillet until golden brown then flip over.</li>
            <li>Lay two slices of cheese on top of the slices of bread, then the meat, then the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Place the bread onto the cheese and use the remaining tablespoon of butter to slowly cook (low heat) the bread bottom, about four minutes. Flip over and do this again. Place on a cutting board to rest once done</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to boil. Crack your egg into a small ramekin, making sure not to break the yolk. Use a spoon to swirl the boiling water in a circle and make a vortex. Tilt the egg into the water, remove from heat, cover the pot,
                and poach the egg until the white is set and the yolk is runny, about 4 minutes.
            </li>    
            <li>Lift out the egg with a slotted spoon and put it on a paper towel to drain.</li>
            <li>Bring the water to boil again and cook the ramen noodles. Drain and place in a bowl</li>
            <li>Bring the ramen broth back to a simmer, then ladle it over the noodles. Lay the poached egg on one side, then cut the grilled cheese into 4 long batons. Place on ramen and top with scallions</li>
        </ol>
