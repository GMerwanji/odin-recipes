        <ul>
            <li>Warm Water - 1/4 cup</li>
            <li>Active Dry Yeast - 1 packet (2 & 1/4 teaspoons)</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour - 3 cups</li>
            <li>Dry Milk Powder - 3 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Granulated Sugar - 3/4 cup</li>
            <li>Baking Powder - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Ground Cardamon* - 2 teaspoons</li>
            <li>Coconut Milk - 1 - 14oz can</li>
            <li>Egg - 1</li>
            <li>Canola Oil - for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the warm water in a large bowl; sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir to combine. Allow the yeast to dissolve in the warm water for five minutes. The mixture should begin to bubble which means the yeast is active and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Once the yeast is ready, mix together the flour, milk powder, sugar, baking powder and cardamon in the same bowl. Add to the yeast mixture and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 cup of coconut milk and 1 egg. Add the coconut milk to the flour mixture until the dough sticks together (you can add more coconut milk if necessary). You can also add more flour, if necessary. The dough should be soft but not too sticky.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough with hands until smooth and elastic (about 10 minutes), coating hands with oil or flour to work into the dough if needed.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a large bowl, coated with cooking spray, turning once to coat. Place plastic wrap over the dough and let the dough rise for about an hour in a warm place or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Punch the dough down and divide evenly into four portions. With a rolling pin, flatten a portion into a circle and cut into six triangles. Repeat previous steps with remaining dough portions.</li>
            <li>Place triangles on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and let sit for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large pan (you want to fill the oil about 3 inches high).</li>
            <li>Fry the mandazi (in batches) on one side until mandazi turns golden brown then flip and fry remaining side for 1 to 2 minutes until golden brown. Cool on paper towels. Repeat with remaining mandazi.</li>
            <li>Mandazi is best served fresh but can be reheated for later use.</li>
