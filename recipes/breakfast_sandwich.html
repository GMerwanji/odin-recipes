        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>New York style breakfast sandwich with a little bit of a California twist. Easy, Delicious, and Portable.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 or 4 slices of bacon or pancetta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for the rolls</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 small soft rolls, cut in half</li>
            <li>2 slices any kind of cheese</li>
            <li>1 small or 1/2 large avocado, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 handfuls of arugula</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon</li>
            <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp and brown</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Whisk the eggs just until the yolks and whites are combined, add them to the pan, and cook, stirring often 
                with a fork, until scrambled and set. Season with salt and pepper. Alternatively, you could fry the eggs sunny-side up in the rendered bacon fat.
            </li>
            <li>Toast the rolls in a toaster, under the broiler, or in skillet over medium high heat and butter them generously. If using the cheese, immediately place a slice on each hot roll so that
                it melts. (if the cheese doesn't melt, warm the cheese toast under the broiler, watching it carefuly to make sure it does not burn.)
            </li>
            <li>Top with the cooked egg and bacon. Layer the avocado and arugula. Squeeze a little lemon juice over the arugula and seson with a pinch of flaky salt. Top with the other half of each roll.</li>
        </ol>
